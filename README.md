## Getting Started


### Run

You can test the program manually through the Makefile

1. Give permission for the script to become executable

    ```bash
    make
    ```

2. Execute the program (with either of the two commands)

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

3. To delete the generated files run

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```


Or use the sh script that runs all test cases present in the test folder, indicating which cases passed

1. Compile and run the program using the provided Makefile

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x runTests.sh
    ```

2. Execute the case tests

    ```bash
    ./runTests.sh
    ```
